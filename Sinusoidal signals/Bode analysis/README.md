# Bode Analysis

Designed a Low-pass filter to reduce measurement noise from a sensor. 
Every sinusoidal component in the input with frequency higher than 100 rad/s is reduced at least by a factor of 10 by the filter. 
The magnitude of any sinusoidal component with frequency lower than 4 rad/s is not changed by the filter by more than Â±10%.
