# Sensitivity analysis

Two distinct P-controllers were considered for the plant P(s) = 10/(s2 +2s+5) and   
C1(s) = 1, C2(s) = 100. The better controller with better performance at different sensitivity were analyzed.
Controller C2 produced better trackign of low frequency reference signal, for frequency below 2 rad/sec. But C1 provides better phase margine compared to C2.
