# Nyquist analysis

1)	Analyzed the stability of unity-gain negative feedback loop with L(s) = 202.5(s + 1)/(s4 +20s3 +126s2 +340s+800) 

2)	Analyzed the stability of unity-gain negative feedback loop with P(s)=0.1/((s+1)(s+0.1)) and C(s)=1/(s+1) for different gains. 

3)	(Analyzing the stability of L0(s) = 20/( s2 +2sâˆ’10) using Nyquist stability criteria.
